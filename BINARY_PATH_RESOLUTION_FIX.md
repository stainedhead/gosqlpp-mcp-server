# Binary-Relative Path Resolution Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

When the MCP server (`mcp_sqlpp`) was executed from within another MCP server or process, it would use the working directory of the parent process to resolve relative paths in the `executable_path` configuration. This caused issues when trying to locate the `sqlpp` executable, as relative paths like `.bin` would resolve against the parent's working directory instead of where the MCP server binary was actually located.

## Solution Implemented

Modified the `GetSqlppExecutablePath()` method in `internal/config/config.go` to resolve relative paths relative to the MCP server binary's location using `os.Executable()`.

### Key Changes

1. **Path Resolution Logic**: Added `resolvePath()` helper method that:
   - Uses `os.Executable()` to determine the binary's location
   - Resolves relative paths against the binary directory
   - Preserves absolute paths as-is
   - Falls back to working directory if binary location cannot be determined

2. **Enhanced GetSqlppExecutablePath()**: Now handles both directory paths and full executable paths correctly while applying the new resolution logic.

## Code Changes

### Before
```go
func (c *SqlppConfig) GetSqlppExecutablePath() string {
    if c.ExecutablePath == "" {
        return filepath.Join(".bin", "sqlpp")
    }
    return filepath.Join(c.ExecutablePath, "sqlpp")
}
```

### After
```go
func (c *SqlppConfig) GetSqlppExecutablePath() string {
    executablePath := c.ExecutablePath
    if executablePath == "" {
        executablePath = ".bin"
    }
    
    if filepath.Base(executablePath) == "sqlpp" {
        return c.resolvePath(executablePath)
    }
    
    sqlppPath := filepath.Join(executablePath, "sqlpp")
    return c.resolvePath(sqlppPath)
}

func (c *SqlppConfig) resolvePath(path string) string {
    if filepath.IsAbs(path) {
        return path
    }
    
    binaryPath, err := os.Executable()
    if err != nil {
        return path // Fallback to original behavior
    }
    
    binaryDir := filepath.Dir(binaryPath)
    return filepath.Join(binaryDir, path)
}
```

## Examples

### Configuration Examples
```yaml
sqlpp:
  executable_path: ".bin"              # → /path/to/mcp_server/.bin/sqlpp
  executable_path: "bin"               # → /path/to/mcp_server/bin/sqlpp  
  executable_path: "/usr/local/bin"    # → /usr/local/bin/sqlpp (unchanged)
```

### Working Directory Independence
- **Before**: `./mcp_sqlpp` from `/different/dir` would look for sqlpp in `/different/dir/.bin/`
- **After**: `./mcp_sqlpp` from `/different/dir` would look for sqlpp in `/path/to/mcp_server/.bin/`

## Testing

### Updated Tests
1. **Unit Tests**: Modified `TestSqlppConfig_GetSqlppExecutablePath` to verify binary-relative resolution
2. **Integration Test**: Enhanced `test-new-config.go` with comprehensive testing scenarios
3. **Manual Tests**: Updated test scripts to use absolute paths for clarity

### Test Results
```bash
✅ All tests passed! New configuration logic works correctly!
   - Relative paths are resolved relative to the MCP server binary directory
   - Absolute paths are preserved as-is  
   - Default .bin directory is resolved relative to binary directory
```

## Documentation Updates

1. **README.md**: Added Path Resolution section explaining the behavior
2. **SQLPP_INTEGRATION.md**: Updated with important path resolution notes
3. **test/README.md**: Added notes about the new behavior
4. **Test Scripts**: Updated to use absolute paths and added explanatory comments

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: MCP server works regardless of working directory
2. **Deployment Flexibility**: Can be launched from any location
3. **Parent Process Independence**: Works correctly when started by other processes
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Absolute paths continue to work as before
5. **Intuitive Behavior**: Relative paths are relative to the binary, which is more logical

## Migration Notes

- **No Breaking Changes**: Absolute paths work exactly as before
- **Improved Behavior**: Relative paths now work more reliably
- **Configuration Update**: No configuration changes required
- **Documentation**: Users should be aware of the new relative path behavior

This fix resolves the core issue where the MCP server couldn't find the sqlpp executable when launched from a different working directory, making the server much more robust and deployable in various environments.

## Logging Directory Resolution Fix

### Problem
The file logging system had the same issue as the sqlpp executable path resolution. When `file_logging: true` was enabled, the `logs/` directory was created relative to the working directory instead of the binary's location, causing logs to be scattered across different directories depending on where the MCP server was launched from.

### Solution
Modified `SetupFileLogging()` in `internal/logging/filelogger.go` to resolve the logs directory relative to the MCP server binary's location:

**Before:**
```go
logsDir := "logs"  // Resolved against working directory
```

**After:**
```go
logsDir := resolveLogsDirPath("logs")  // Resolved against binary directory
```

Added `resolveLogsDirPath()` function that uses the same `os.Executable()` approach as the sqlpp path resolution.

### Benefits
- Log files are consistently created in the same location relative to the binary
- No scattered log files across different working directories
- Predictable log file locations for monitoring and debugging
- Works correctly when server is launched by other processes

### Examples

**Configuration remains the same:**
```yaml
log:
  file_logging: true
```

**Behavior change:**
- **Before**: Logs created in `$WORKING_DIR/logs/`
- **After**: Logs created in `$BINARY_DIR/logs/`

This ensures logs are always in a predictable location relative to where the MCP server binary is installed.
