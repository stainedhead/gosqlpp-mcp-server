### Preparatoin

Ensure you have reviewed the added documentation, technical details and requirements so you have the information you need to understand the application.  Use tools if needed to do added research.

Think deeply about the features above.  Develop a plan and share the plan with me before you begin to generate the code.  Once I have approved the plan, execute the plan and ensure you lint and run the unit tests on the code until it is complete and builds and tests completely.  Once complete, the last step is to document the work you did, and store that work within a file named 000-initial-product-results.md
