# Configuration Changes Summary

## Overview
Updated the gosqlpp MCP server to expect the sqlpp executable in a directory specified by `executable_path`, rather than treating `executable_path` as the full path to the executable.

## Key Changes

### 1. Configuration Structure (`internal/config/config.go`)
- **CHANGED**: `SqlppConfig.ExecutablePath` now represents a directory path, not a file path
- **ADDED**: `GetSqlppExecutablePath()` method that returns the full path to the sqlpp executable
- **CHANGED**: Default value for `executable_path` changed from "sqlpp" to ".bin"

### 2. Code Updates
- **UPDATED**: `internal/sqlpp/executor.go` - Uses `GetSqlppExecutablePath()` instead of `ExecutablePath` directly
- **UPDATED**: `internal/server/server.go` - Uses resolved executable path for validation
- **UPDATED**: `cmd/server/main.go` - Logs the resolved executable path

### 3. Configuration Files
- **UPDATED**: `config.yaml` - Changed default and added clarifying comments
- **UPDATED**: `test/config/test-config-file-logging.yaml` - Updated to use directory path and moved to test directory

### 4. Tests
- **UPDATED**: `internal/config/config_test.go` - Added tests for new default and `GetSqlppExecutablePath()` method
- **UPDATED**: `tests/integration/integration_test.go` - Updated to create mock executable in directory structure

### 5. Scripts
- **UPDATED**: `test/scripts/test-manual.sh` - Modified to create mock sqlpp in `mock-bin/` directory and moved to test directory

### 6. Documentation
- **UPDATED**: `README.md` - Updated configuration examples and environment variable examples
- **UPDATED**: `documentation/SQLPP_INTEGRATION.md` - Clarified new configuration behavior
- **UPDATED**: `documentation/product-generation-results.md` - Updated default configuration example

## New Behavior

**Before:**
```yaml
sqlpp:
  executable_path: "sqlpp"  # Could be just command name or full path
```

**After:**
```yaml
sqlpp:
  executable_path: ".bin"  # Directory containing sqlpp executable
```

The server now:
1. Takes the `executable_path` as a directory
2. Automatically appends `/sqlpp` to get the full executable path
3. Defaults to looking in the `.bin` directory

## Backward Compatibility
This is a breaking change. Users will need to update their configuration:
- If they had `executable_path: "sqlpp"`, they should change to `executable_path: ".bin"` and ensure sqlpp is in the `.bin` directory
- If they had a full path like `executable_path: "/usr/local/bin/sqlpp"`, they should change to `executable_path: "/usr/local/bin"`

## Testing
All unit tests and integration tests have been updated to work with the new configuration structure.

## Test Directory Reorganization

As part of cleaning up the project structure, all test-related files have been moved to a dedicated `test/` directory:

### Moved Files
- `test-config-file-logging.yaml` → `test/config/test-config-file-logging.yaml`
- `test-file-logging.sh` → `test/scripts/test-file-logging.sh`
- `test-file-logging-tools.sh` → `test/scripts/test-file-logging-tools.sh`
- `test-simple-logging.sh` → `test/scripts/test-simple-logging.sh`
- `test-manual.sh` → `test/scripts/test-manual.sh`
- `test-mcp-commands.json` → `test/data/test-mcp-commands.json`
- `final-test.json` → `test/data/final-test.json`
- `test-new-config.go` → `test/test-new-config.go`
- `test.db` → `test/data/test.db` (if present)

### Updated Script Behavior
- All test scripts now check that they're being run from the project root directory
- Test configuration files have been updated with correct relative paths
- A comprehensive `test/README.md` documents the new test structure

## Binary-Relative Path Resolution Fix

### Problem
When the MCP server was launched from a different working directory than where the binary was located, relative paths in `executable_path` would resolve against the working directory instead of the binary's location. This caused issues when the server was started by another process or from a different directory.

### Solution
Modified `GetSqlppExecutablePath()` to resolve relative paths relative to the MCP server binary's location using `os.Executable()`:

**Before:**
```go
// Relative paths resolved against working directory
return filepath.Join(c.ExecutablePath, "sqlpp")
```

**After:**
```go
// Relative paths resolved against binary directory
binaryPath, _ := os.Executable()
binaryDir := filepath.Dir(binaryPath)
return filepath.Join(binaryDir, path)
```

### Benefits
- MCP server can find sqlpp regardless of working directory
- More reliable when server is launched by other processes
- Consistent behavior in different deployment scenarios
- Absolute paths still work as before

### Updated Tests
- Modified unit tests to account for binary-relative resolution
- Enhanced test-new-config.go to demonstrate the new behavior
- Updated integration tests and manual test scripts
